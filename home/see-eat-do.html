Ain’t it such a beauty.<br />Second would be Ina Coolbrith Park for a great view of the San Francisco skyline.<br />And lastly, Dolores Park in the Mission District.<br />It’s my go-to spot to just chill and catch up with some friends.</p>

            <div class="center-text"><p><h1>DO</h1><p>San Francisco has no shortage of amazing museums and galleries.<br />With over 8 floors to explore, The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA)<br /> is the place to go to see art in all its forms; sculpture, painting, installations, graphic design, and photography.<br />The Museum of Ice Cream (MOIC) is a pop-up museum where you can explore the different rooms and <br />take pics for your instagram (and eat lots of ice cream of course!). <br />Lastly, the Chandran Gallery is my newest discovery of SF galleries to visit. <br />They are a contemporary art gallery that rotate what’s on display every few month. <br />On display right now is “Intertwine”, an installation by Rebecca Louise Law, all real flowers! Plus it’s free to visit!</p>
